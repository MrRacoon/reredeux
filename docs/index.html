  <h2>Ducks</h2>

  <p>Ducks are objects that describe redux state transitions.</p>

  <p>
    The goal is to isolate all code for every action in a single place. Making
    transitions simpler to maintain, and quicker to analyze.
  </p>

  {% highlight javascript %}
    const increment = {

      // This is typically what you would use for the name of your action
      // creator.
      name: 'increment',

      // Your action creator
      action: payload => ({ payload }),

      // Your transducer,
      // You've seen them as the case blocks within switch statements.
      reducer: (s, { payload }) =>
        payload
          ? s + payload
          : s + 1
    }
  {% endhighlight %}

  <h3>Modules</h3>

  <p>
    Ducks get organized into modules. Each module needs an initial state, a few
    selectors for selecting information (functions that recieve the modules
    state as the argument), and a list of ducks for modifying pieces of that
    state.
  </p>

  {% highlight javascript %}
    const increment = { ... };
    const decrement = { ... };

    const module = {
      // The initial state should reflect the state that your ducks will be
      // manipulating.
      init: 0,

      // A map of selectors, for extracting state from the above contract.
      select: {
        val  : s => s,
        succ : s => s + 1,
        pred : s => s - 1,
      },

      // The list of all of the ducks that interact at this level with the
      // state.
      ducks: [
        increment,
        decrement,
      ]
    };
  {% endhighlight %}

  <h3>Deux</h3>

  <p>
    The <code>deux</code> function is very powerful. It has the ability to merge
    modules and organize our branches of state. This is done by recursively
    descending the spec we provide. The return value, uses the shape of the tree
    to annotate and patch the action and reducer functions to account for all of
    the nesting.
  </p>

  <p>
    This enables us to reuse state, in multiple places, such as the
    <code>counter</code> in this example:
  </p>

  {% highlight javascript %}
    const app = deux({
      example: {
        phonebook,
        counter,
      },
      otherState: {
        todo,
        counter,
      }
    });
  {% endhighlight %}

  <hr>
  <br>
  <h3>Rere</h3>

  <p>
    Once we have a state declared the way we want, we'll call <code>rere</code>
    on it to extract everything we'll need to plug in to our redux store.
  </p>
  <p>
    For convinience sake, there is a function called <code>reredeux</code> which
    composes both <code>rere</code> and <code>deux</code>. Often times you'll
    only need this function, since you can technically use it anywhere
    <code>deux</code> is used.
  </p>

  {% highlight javascript %}
    const counter = {
      init: 0,
      select: { val: s => s },
      ducks: [ increment, decrement ]
    };
    const { reducer, init, actions, select } =
      reredeux({
        data: {
          counter,
        },
        otherData: {
          counter,
        }
      });

    const store = createStore(reducer, init);
    store.getState();
    // { data: { counter: 0 }, otherData: { counter: 0 } }
  {% endhighlight %}

  <hr>
  <br>
  <h3>Actions and Selectors</h3>

  <p>
    Once you've created your store, you'll have access to <code>actions</code>
    and <code>select</code>. Both objects mimic the shape of your state tree.
  </p>

  {% highlight javascript %}
    store.dispatch(actions.data.counter.increment());
    store.dispatch(actions.data.counter.increment());

    select.data.counter.val(store.getState()) // 2
    select.otherData.counter.val(store.getState()) // 0

    store.dispatch(actions.data.counter.decrement());

    select.data.counter._(store.getState()) // 1
    select.otherData.counter.val(store.getState()) // 0
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>
    <b>NOTE:</b> there is a convinience selector added to every level of the
    state tree. This selector is denoted with the <code>_</code> character, and
    will return all of the state at that level on down.
  </p>
